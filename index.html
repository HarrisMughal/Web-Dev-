            <p class ="book-desc"> Given a second chance at life, Arthur Leywin wishes above all to grow strong enough to protect his family,
                 as the memory of his cold and disconnected past life as King Grey still haunts him. To this end,
                  Arthur adopts the persona of the masked adventurer, Note, 
                 and delves into the dungeons under the forbidding Beast Glades.
                  On his adventures, Arthur discovers a strange magical blade that responds to the 
                  dragon’s will inside him, befriends a powerful young conjurer whose past is shrouded in mystery, 
                  and battles the deadly Elderwood Guardian.
                   Yet all his efforts might prove for naught when Arthur makes an enemy of a talented
                   conjurer from a very powerful family, putting his very future at risk.</p>

            <p class ="book-desc">Though Arthur Leywin would like nothing more than to pursue his studies at the esteemed Xyrus Academy, 
                where he hopes to push his already potent magical abilities to new plateaus
                 and perhaps discover something more about his reincarnation into this world, 
                he finds the politics of the school’s halls even more challenging to navigate than 
                those of the council chambers he once inhabited as King Grey. 
                Arthur faces inept professors, jealous classmates, 
                and an overeager director while fending off the affection of an old friend and the aggression of an old enemy.
                 Then a routine class trip into a low-level dungeon turns out to be anything but,
                  and Arthur discovers something that will change his life forever. </p>

            <p class ="book-desc">In another life, Arthur Leywin was a king and no stranger to war. 
                He was not ready, however, to find himself at the heart of a conflict that will reshape his entire new world.
                 Despite his abilities, it seems as if the danger only increases with every discovery he makes.
                  His oldest friend succumbs to a power that may destroy her, a power Arthur gave her. 
                  His most constant foe accepts a dark gift to challenge Arthur’s strength, an act that threatens all of Xyrus Academy.
                   How can he keep his family safe if his very presence is the thing that draws danger to them? 
                   Can he dispel the specters of war before it is too late?</p>
